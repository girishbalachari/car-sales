Stan car sales

The Backend
… needs to provide the data from the .csv file to the frontend via a

Hints
- We’re working agile and iteratively - put as much in the prototype 
that you could code in an evening, and select one piece where you 
really want to shine. The following communication and discussion 
is more important than the code!
- You don’t need to write tests for everything - it’s enough that your 
testing strategy becomes visible - know when to stop.
- The csv file might not be the best or consistent data structure. 
Decide how to deal with errors and ambiguity.
- Provide all executable applications (client and backend) in a single 
zip file with instructions to run - add answers to question 1) and 2) 
as a section in the readme file.
- Don’t forget to have some fun while implementing the app - it’s 
quite similar to what we do here everyday.
